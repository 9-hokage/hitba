## Hitba -  muslim dating app.

# Proposal


## Alternative/Market Research:

At the moment, we have many dating services designed for different types of people, such as:

 - Tinder - This is one of the most popular dating services, but there
   can be a variety of people, different religions and worldviews, so
   there is little chance of meeting a person by their religion. The
   sample is too large.
   
  - Muslima - We have the same service for Muslims, but there is a minus
that there are few people in the CIS space and have not entirely
incorrect data to fill in, and we think we can improve them.

## Goals:

This project is based on dates with a long term proposal. Our goal is to make it simpler to find a person, who is interested in it like you, who has values like you, who thinks in the same direction, and not become a victim of deceit, or violence. This platform should make dating with valued people easier. It makes finding these people more accessible for people in post-soviet countries.

in our current world you should find it with network of your parents or friends and with this platform it become more effective

## Describe technologies that will be used, describe domain (classes, ERD)

We will use different technologies to achieve maximum stability and security. To implement the backend, we will use the **fastapi** framework. Fastapi allows you to quickly write services for projects, it is also very intuitive. In the role of the frontend, we will use the iOS application. In the Swift language, you can write very high-quality and stable code. We will also use different servers for testing. This will help us write code independently of each other.

## Non-functional requirements

 1. Chat
 2. Asking about showing a private information (phone number, address and    etc.) after conversation
 3. Asking about continue current dialog after some time
 4. Pre-date warning about security
 5. Complex authorization

## Risks

The risk may come in realization because of complex requirements of shariat, second part is the difficult confidentiality of users ' data, about safety and performance of our app.

In other cases in post-soviet countries doesn't exist popular application in this area

## Future iterations

For future updates:

 - adding a list of courses for preparing for marriage relationship
